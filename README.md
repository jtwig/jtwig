# JTwig 1.0 Beta

*JTwig is a template mechanism, inspired in [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) (PHP), for [SpringFramework Web MVC](http://www.springsource.org) (Java).*

### Why beta?

It is currently in beta version stage - we are testing it under heavy scenarios, in real world cases. It will also be enhanced by adding quite a few functions.


### Architecture

JTwig architecture is really simple. It consists of a [Parboiled Parser](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled), that processes the template. After assembling all Extends and Includes macros, it renders the output.

### Example

File: layout.twig
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
	&lt;head&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;{% block title %}Unknown{% endblock %}&lt;/title&gt;
	&lt;/head&gt;
	&lt;body&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;This is a test&lt;/h1&gt;
		{% block content %}
		No content defined
		{% endblock %}
	&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

File: hello.twig
<pre><code>{% extends 'layout.twig' %}
{% block title %}Hello World Page{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>
